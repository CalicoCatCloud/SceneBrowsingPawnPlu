This plug-in, named BIMPawn, not only has the most basic front and back, left and right, up and down and Angle rotation functions, but also implements more advanced functions to meet the needs of different projects. The details include:
Acceleration and deceleration: Users can easily adjust the movement speed of Pawn to adapt to different scenario requirements.


Fixed point zoom: allows the user to zoom the scene at a specific location for easy observation of details.
Fixed point rotation: The user can rotate the Angle of view at the specified position to get a more comprehensive display of the scene.
Record in read coordinates: The user can record the current position of the Pawn and quickly return to that position if needed.
Flight mode: Pawn can fly freely in the scene, providing users with a more flexible way to move.
In the model play: The Pawn is automatically positioned to the center position of the model, which is convenient for users to observe and operate.
Scene roaming: The preset roaming path allows Pawn to automatically move through the scene, showing the overall layout of the project.
Moving buffer:There will be a slow glide at the end of the movement.
